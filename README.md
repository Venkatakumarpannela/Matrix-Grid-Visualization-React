Matrix Grid Visualization
A responsive React application that visualizes data in a dynamic grid format using HTML Canvas. This project demonstrates key frontend development skills, including state management, API integration, and performance optimization for data-heavy visualizations.

Features
HTML Canvas Rendering: Utilizes the HTML Canvas API for efficient, low-level drawing of the grid, ensuring high performance.

Interactive Cells: Allows users to click on individual grid cells to display detailed information.

Mock API Integration: Simulates fetching data from a REST API with a realistic loading state to showcase asynchronous data handling.

State Management: Employs React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage application state, including grid data, loading status, and user selections.

Responsive Design: The canvas adapts to different screen sizes and device pixel ratios (DPR) to maintain a sharp, clear visualization on all devices.

Clean UI/UX: The application features a simple, modern design built with Tailwind CSS for an intuitive user experience.

Technical Skills Demonstrated
React.js: Core knowledge of functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef), and component-based architecture.

JavaScript (JS): Strong foundation in asynchronous programming (async/await, Promise), array manipulation (Array.from, map), and event handling.

HTML & CSS: Expertise in semantic HTML, responsive design principles, and styling with a utility-first CSS framework (Tailwind CSS).

REST API: Understanding of how to interact with an API endpoint to fetch and handle data.

Debugging: Includes built-in error handling and console logging for easy troubleshooting.

UI/UX: Focus on creating a clear, interactive, and visually appealing interface.
